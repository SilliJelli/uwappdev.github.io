                            We welcome volunteers! Every Thursday, we give a presentation. <u><i>You</i></u> can help us provide one!

                            At present, we focus on Swift and Flutter; however, we welcome presentations related to other
                            frameworks and platforms. As Spring Quarter meetings are online, we will be giving these presentations over
                            Zoom. Contact us through Discord to propose a presentation!

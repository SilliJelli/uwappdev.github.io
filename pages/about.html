                                We teach each other to develop mobile apps! Every Thursday, we give a presentation on
                                some portion of a mobile framework. Tuesdays, more expierenced members are available
                                during meeting times to answer questions.

                                Tuesday meetings are project-work meetings! We expect you to have a project ready to ask
                                questions about. Share what you've been doing with us, or even work on a group project.
                                Tuesday meetings are a valuable time to work on projects.

                                SwiftUI. If you are interested in learning another framework
                                we encourage you to learn it and share what you have learned with the club!

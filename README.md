# uwappdev.github.io
The website for the Mobile Development RSO at the University of Washington.

# Why such a small website?
We are encouraging our members to [redo the website in Flutter](https://github.com/uwappdev/uwappdev.github.io/tree/flutter_redo/site)!
We do, however, recognise the need for a functioning website, so we have this temporary page! If you are a current student
at the University of Washington and interested in learning Flutter, please contribute! Show us what you are learning!

# Pull Request Guidelines
Students submitting pull requests should include a clear description of what was changed and why.
If a new page was added to the website, please, give yourself credit! If the new page demonstrates
some part of Flutter, provide a page that describes this feature.

# FAQ
## Do you plan on keeping the HTML version of the page?
For now, yes. Until the Flutter branch has enough information and functionality to adequately showcase
our club, we plan to keep this version of the website.

## Can I submit pull requests for the HTML site?
Yes, however, we are more likely to include and review pull requests submitted to the Flutter
branch.
